About ASI loader - original code by listener ([XLiveLess](http://gtaforums.com/topic/388658-relgtaiv-xliveless/))<br />
The ASI loader allows for loading of custom-made DLL files without the need of a separate injector.<br />
Such DLL files must be renamed to *.asi and put in a subfolder named *ASI* inside the game's executable folder (*Binaries* for ME1/2, *Win32* for ME3).<br />
For testing purposes, the ASI loader will, alternatively, load plugins from *Binaries*/*Win32* if the *ASI* subfolder is missing or nothing was successfully loaded from there.
