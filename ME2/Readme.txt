Welcome to the ME2 binkw32 project.

Readme.txt => some cheap text file written in Notepad.

binkw32.sln => open solution (duh!)

binkw23.dll => original binkw32.dll from Mass Effect 2.

Release folder => latest compiled version, if you're here and don't know what to do, just copy the 2 DLL's there to 'Mass Effect 2\Binaries' and be done with it.
